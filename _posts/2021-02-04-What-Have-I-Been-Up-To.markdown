It felt like i  had a lot to do lately. I don't know if i should chalk it up to it being the saddest time of the year (was january) or if it REALLY have been busy. Here is the past few weeks summed up.

## Work

A lot of things are happening. Not really much to say about the work itself, except that things are indeed happening.

## Reading about Azure

I recently purchased some books:

- Microsoft Azure by Soh, Copeland, Puca and Harris
- Learn Powershell & Lean Powershell Scripting by Jones Hicks.

I think "Microsoft Azure" reads well, and gives a neat introduction to many concepts and services of Azure. It does however seem to be a little unfinished. Some words are spelled wrong and some sentences does not appear to make much sense. Its worse with the images. Many of them are compressed and straight down unreadable as they are in the book.
But I still think the book is worth to read for anyone wishing to get a structured introduction to Azure, or simply want a refresher, as was the case for me.
I have not yet began reading the powershell ones, even tough i have been been playing with some scripting.

## Explored PowerShell  

An discussion about allowing external stakeholders to our Azure DevOps Project started some days ago. A key question was "what" and "how" we expect them to collaborate with us.
I immediately wanted to make our process of getting orders more effective by giving the stakeholders a way to create work items (i.e Epics, User stories, etc) by way of Automation. So i started to explore if PowerShell was suitable for the tasks, and at this time I DO have a lead. Wether or not it pans out for our use case and environment remains to see and could deserve its own post.

## Explored ARM Templates and will be holding an Introduction to Infrastructure-as-Code

ARM Templates is something i have discussed before in a blog post on medium <https://medium.com/sopra-steria-norge/use-azure-policies-and-arm-templates-to-control-your-azure-environment-4c1896908064>
I think its a great tool and show how "as-Code" can be used in modern environments. I wont cover it here just yet, look at the medium post instead. I spent some time these weeks to learn about Terraform, and a little about Azure Bicep. These are definitively things i want to explore further when i have the opportunity

### Speaking of the medium post

The post on medium went well for my first post of that format. At the time of writing it have 123 reads (yes, really), 370 views and 3 fans. I didn't know what to expect, but i think its fine. Maybe i can improve the engagement on a later post?

### Holding an introduction to IaC

I was asked to hold a little presentation for students in the student organization i was a part of. I asked around a little and found that most had heard of but not used IaC before, so i decided to run with that. Now me and a colleague are preparing some slides and some code to showcase IaC. Its fun, and we have kind of free reins when it comes to the presentation

## Got kind of addicted to Warzone

Me and some friends from NTNU recently started playing COD: WarZone. Its fun, but when i start playing times goes way faster than what it does when i do something i should be doing.
"*im not addicted, i swear*"
